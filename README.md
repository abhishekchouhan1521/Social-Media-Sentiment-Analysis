# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to perform sentiment analysis on social media data, such as tweets. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the content of the text. The project uses the **TextBlob** and **scikit-learn** libraries for sentiment analysis and machine learning.
